          <strong>BRIEF HISTORY OF QUIRINO PROVINCE</strong>
         <P>  I. The youngest Province in Cagayan Valley Region II consist of only six (6) municipalities namely
              Cabarroguis,
              (its capital) Diffun, Saguday, Aglipay, Maddela and Nagtipunan. During its creation on the year 1970 it
              has
              an estimated population of 49,767. After thirty (30) years of existence, on census year 2000 it has a
              total
              population of 147,100 with a 2.50% annual growth rate.

              Quirino Province acquired its juridical personality as a result of the division of the Province of Nueva
              Vizcaya on June 18, 1966 under R.A. 4734. It was named in the honor of the then President Elpidio A.
              Quirino. The municipalities of Diffun, Maddela, Saguday and Aglipay composed the newly born sub-province
              and
              the first elected Lieutenant Governor in the 1967 general elections was Hon. Jose B. Aquino.

              On June 21, 1969, three years after its birth as a sub- province, R.A. 5554 was enacted amending R.A. 4734
              creating the Municipality of Cabarroguis taken from portions of the municipalities of Diffun, Saguday and
              Aglipay. The Act was introduced and sponsored by former Congressman Floro S. Crisologo and Melanio T.
              Singson.

              Finally, R.A. 6394 was passed on September 10, 1971 further amending R.A. No. 5554 separating the
              sub-province of Quirino from its mother province of Nueva Vizcaya constituting into a regular province.
              Hon.
              Leonardo B. Perez former Congressman, Senator, Chairman of the Commission on Elections and Concurrently
              the
              Political Affairs Minister and Hon. Benjamin B. Perez, former Congressman and Assemblyman for Region II at
              the Interim Batasang Pambansa(IBP), had worked for the passage of R.A. 6394.

              A portion of this province was formerly a part of the province of Isabela which was recovered and restored
              to the province of Nueva Vizcaya by the late Congressman Leon Cabarroguis for which the provincial capital
              was named in his honor.</p>

            <p>
              II. GEOGRAPHY

              The province of Quirino is seated at the southern part of Region 02. Quirino’s total land area of 305,720
              hectares consisted of six municipalities, namely: Diffun at the northern tip, inwardly facing south is the
              capital town of Cabarroguis, Saguday at the east, Aglipay at the center, followed by Maddela and the
              southernmost town of Nagtipunan. It constitutes 11% of the Region’s total land area.

              Geographically, the province of Quirino is bounded by the province of Nueva Vizcaya in the west and
              southwest, province of Isabela in the north and northeast, and the province of Maria Aurora in the south.

              Though a small province, Quirino is highly significant in the Region in terms of economic and
              environmental considerations. The importance is viewed the fact that headwaters of the country’s biggest
              River System called the Cagayan River. That she holds the upper tip of the river that emanates from the
              province with its direction of the flow down the entire length of the Cagayan Valley to the north. Three
              other rivers drain the rainwater and underground water of Quirino, namely: Ganano River at northern
              Quirino, Dumatata River, and Addalem River, and the Casecnan and Conwaprivers joining the Upper Cagayan
              River within Quirino area. The common outlet of these rivers all connects to Cagayan River in Southern
              Isabela.

              These major tributary rivers are significant water resources which are an indicator that Quirino province
              has the biggest upland watershed area of the Region. In fact, the Cagayan Valley Plains starts at the
              foothills of Quirino province. Hence, Quirino is consistently having four major watersheds that are
              environmentally fragile. In the wholeness, Quirino given its allocation of vast highlands could pose a
              region-wide menace if not adequately managed and protected.

          <h1> PROVINCIAL SEAL</h1>
          <img src="./assets/images/Ph_seal_quirino01.png" class="gov-seal">
          <div class="seal-content">
           <p> The features or images captured in the corporate seal represent the province’s potentials – the mountains
            replicate the Sierra Madre
            Series in the eastern part of the province and the Caraballo and Mamparang ranges in the south.
            It also illustrates that majority of its land resources are rolling to steep and very steep areas. In the
            middle right hand corner of
            the seal are trees that represent its major natural resources. It also signifies that the province contains
            the upper Cagayan River basin watershed.
            The replica of bundled rice, tobacco and corn identifies the three (3) main crops grown in the province as a
            source of living. The lower portion of
            the seal represents the abundance of inland bodies of freshwater. This portion of the seal also divided the
            middle that signifies that the Cagayan River
            dissects this inland province of which other small rivers and tributaries flow to the mouth at Aparri,
            Cagayan.
